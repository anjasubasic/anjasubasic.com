            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>My name is Anja (pronounced AHN-yuh) and I am originally from Belgrade, Serbia. I currently live in Hanover, NH, where I am pursuing an
              <span class="text-highlight">M.S. in Computer Science.</span> at <span class="text-highlight">Dartmouth College.</span> Prior to coming to Dartmouth,
              I lived in Joplin, MO, where I got my undergraduate degrees in <span class="text-highlight">Computer Science and Music Performance/Percussion</span>.</p>

              <p>I enjoy running, travelling, good food and coffee, playing classical and jazz music and learning new stuff :)</p>

              <h2>Experience</h2>

              <p>I currently work as a research assistant for professor V.S. Subrahmanian at Dartmouth College. The project I am currently working on attempts to predict influence of membership and relationship changes in a terrorist network, and how knowledge about those patterns can be further used to destabilize a terrorist network. </p>

              <p>Prior to this position, I worked at Leggett & Platt Inc. in Carthage, MO, as a C# software engineer. I started as an intern at the beginning of my senior year of college, in September 2016, and was hired as a full-time developer a month or so later. I accepted the position and went on to work as full-time engineer, while still finishing my senior year of college and working on coursework and my undergraduate thesis. At Leggett & Platt, I worked on ETL applications written in C#, large databases, and improving the new Enterprise Resource Planning system the company had just converted to - Microsoft Dynamics AX. Although big manufacturing corporations aren’t really my cup of tea, I was surprised to find myself enjoying development for such a large number of users and the challenges that come with it, as well as working with big data.</p>

              <p>Before Leggett & Platt, I interned at a local Joplin software development company, PILR Tech, for about a year, where I gained a lot of my C# knowledge and some experience with web development. I spent most of my time there working on a Windows Store application and going through OOP training. I also worked independently on a simple website for a company initiative that has an objective to incorporate programming courses into the local high school and middle school curriculum, and get more kids who do not come from a technical background to try and enjoy coding.</p>

              <p>Some of the relevant classes I have taken so far include:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Smartphone Programming (Android)</li>
                <li>Database Systems</li>
                <li>Machine Learning Research</li>
                <li>iOS Development (Swift)</li>
                <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
                <li>Data Structures</li>
                <li>UNIX System Administration</li>
                <li>Information Systems</li>
                <li>Computer Networks</li>
                <li>Operating Systems</li>
                <li>IT Project Management</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                In the future, I would like to gain more experience in machine learning, and fully utilize working for one of the leading experts in the field. The research I have done so far has been very rewarding and I would like to continue doing similar work in the future. I am, however, still more interested in working in the industry than academia, which is why I am pursuing an M.S. degree with research rather than a PhD. I'm currently looking for an internship for Summer 2018, after which I will be available for a full-time position, as I am planning to graduate in March 2019.
